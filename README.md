# Health-Monitoring-System-Arduino
A microcontroller-based health monitoring system built using Arduino Uno. The system measures heart rate (KY-039) and body temperature (DHT11), displays them on an I2C LCD, broadcasts the data over Bluetooth (HC-05), and sends SMS alerts via SIM900A GSM module upon user confirmation.
